# retejs-vue2-starter

Starter template for ReteJS with Vue 2.6.11. Taken from https://github.com/allexpleblord/rete-vue-boilerplate, with dependencies updated to "JUST Work out of the box".

## Note:

This is a ReteJS example that uses a lot of plugins, you don't need to use all of them. As [explained in the docs](https://rete.js.org/#/examples/basic), the required ones are:

> * rete-connection-plugin
> * rete-vue-render-plugin
> * rete-context-menu-plugin (could be ommited but it's _really necessary_ for most cases in my opinion).

You also need to install the "rete" package which is the core module of ReteJS.
